\section{List as many ethical issues as possible}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Should Wang take care of his parents or pay more attention on work?
\item Should Wang report the heating issue to the supervisor Lu?
\item Should Lu give Wang more time on the heating issue?
\item Should Lu follow the advice of the management of Kitten to make the heater available before all issues solved?
\item Should Kitten keep the information of financial difficulties from the employees?
\item Should Lu release the products with heating issue and recall them later?
\item Should Wang follow the advice of Lu to ignore this issue now?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Choose the most important one}

The most important one is ``Should Wang follow the advice of Lu to ignore this issue now?''. I think it is the final question in this case, Wang should consider many other things, like family, supervisor, the company and etc., except from engineering ethics before making the decision.
